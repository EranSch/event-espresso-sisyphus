#Event Espresso Sisyphus
Bring the convenience of Sisyphus's Local Storage based form persistence to Event Espresso!

##What is Sisyphus?
Plugin developed to save html forms data to LocalStorage to restore them after browser crashes, tabs closings and other disasters.

Description and sample are available at http://sisyphus-js.herokuapp.com/

Smashing Magazine article: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/05/sisyphus-js-client-side-drafts-and-more/

##Usage
1. Install, activate plugin
3. ???
4. Profit!!

When active, Sisyphus is automatically loaded on event registration pages. Using a field suffix, registration data is kept specific to each event. This plugin includes only a small addition to the default Sisyphus functionality which is a notification upon data restoration fixed to the bottom of the screen...
