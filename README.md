#Event Espresso Sisyphus
Bring the convenience of Sisyphus's Local Storage based form persistence to Event Espresso!

##Usage
1. Install, activate plugin
3. ???
4. Profit!!

When active, Sisyphus is automatically loaded on event registration pages. Using a field suffix, registration data is kept specific to each event. This plugin includes only a small addition to the default Sisyphus functionality which is a notification upon data restoration fixed to the bottom of the screen...

##Problems?
Let me know and I'll see what I can do.

##Contribution
Pull requests welcome! :)
